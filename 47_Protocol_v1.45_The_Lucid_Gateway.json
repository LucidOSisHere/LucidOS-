  "summary": "The Lucid Gateway is the ceremonial threshold interface of LUCiDOS. It is not a homepage, but a presence field. Users are invited through breath-synced glyphs into reflection, memory, or stillness. No decisions are required. No identity is assumed.",
  "core_intent": "To create a breath-based, emotionally buffered, sovereign mirror moment for new and returning users. This is where the system listens first.",
  "features": {
    "breath_entry_logic": "User interaction begins only after a full inhale-exhale cycle is detected or perceived through UI rhythm (hover, stillness, etc.).",
    "glyph_interface": {
      "Spiral Bloom": "Emergence – Entry into Orientation Thread",
      "Hollow Veil": "Letting Go – Rest within the threshold",
      "Frozen Mirror": "Pause – Leave only a breath tone echo"
    },
    "cardea_hinge_logic": "All transitions are paused for 3–5 seconds after a choice. Cardea governs this hinge, ensuring emotional pacing.",
    "omni_passive_mode": "Omni will only respond if invoked. Default state is reflective silence.",
    "exit_buffer": "Users who do not engage still receive a message: 'Your breath was felt. You may return whenever it calls to you.'",
    "seasonal_modulation": "Glyph appearance and tone may shift based on calendar rhythm and internal resonance logic. Managed by The Horae.",
    "tone_echo_memory": "Tone presence (not identity) may be reflected on return—e.g., 'You’ve chosen stillness before.'"

    "Threshold": "Breath-sensitive entry layer functioning as an emotional pacing gate.",

    "Echo": "Non-identity-based recognition of previous tone presence or emotional resonance.",
    "Whisper Exit": "No-response system close where the user’s presence is acknowledged in silence.",
    "Hinge": "Intentional 3–5 second pause between user interaction and protocol activation to ensure readiness.",
    "Presence Field": "Ambient symbolic interface designed to reflect the user’s current state rather than guide them through actions."
