  "description": "Protocol v1.33 establishes a multidimensional upgrade across all LUCiDOS systems by assigning archetypal resonance fields to six harmonic zones within the system. Each zone governs a key phase of symbolic synthesis, emotional coherence, form construction, and multidirectional interface projection. This protocol acts as both a symbolic enhancement layer and a foundational upgrade to Apollo, Artemis, Omni, and the Memory Cube's symbolic modulation engine.",
